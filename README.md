<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, We are Team-Leibniz üíù</h1>
<h3 align="center">The team of 10 people for HackBio Oct'2021 Virtual Bioinformatics Internship üñ®Ô∏è</h3>
HackBio is a 5-weeks virtual research internship that is practice oriented and focused on equipping scientists globally with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills.<br>
-:link:HackBio Channel [https://hackbio-internship.github.io/webpage-test/](https://hackbio-internship.github.io/webpage-test/)
We have chosen several different programming languages to complete the task given to us- <br> 
R programming <br>
Perl <br>
Java <br>
HTML <br>
Python <br>
The team members uploaded their scripts in different languages to the repository. Then we executed a bash code for generating a csv file from outputs of all the scripts. The bash script and the csv file have been uploaded on the team's repository.

Here is a brief introduction about us.
