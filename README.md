## Project :clipboard: <br>
> This is the main repository for the HackBio Oct'2021 Virtual Internship Experience. <br>
Main goal of the project is write small scripts in different languages with output as - `Name, Email Id, Slack_Username, Biostack`.<br>
Next step is to make csv file with rows corresponding to the person and columns to the values (as name, e-mail, etc) using bash scripts. <br>

We have chosen several different programming languages such as : - <br> 
:small_orange_diamond:R programming <br>
:small_orange_diamond:Perl <br>
:small_orange_diamond:Java <br>
:small_orange_diamond:HTML <br>
:small_orange_diamond:Python <br>
& wrote bash script in Linux Environment <br>
We have uploaded the scripts and csv file in this git repo. <br>
